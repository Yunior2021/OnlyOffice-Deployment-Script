# OnlyOffice-Deployment-Script
Purpose:
- Easy deployment of OnlyOffice in a standalone server with nodejs in just a few minutes.

Supported OS:
- CentOS 7: Use Onlyoffice-CentOS7-installer.sh "IT WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY ON CentOS 8" due repositories and dependencies not included.
- Ubuntu 18.04: Use Onlyoffice-Ubuntu18.04-installer.sh "Not tested on newer versions of ubuntu, feel free to try it."

Note:<br/>
The script for ubuntu installs "OnlyOffice Document Server" limited to 20 users. 
The one for CentOS will install "Only Office Document Server - Integration Edition" and you will need a license for it. 
However it's possible to try it out for 30 days.
<br/><br/>
What version of OnlyOffice you want to install can be changed on the script by replacing with the desired reporitory.
